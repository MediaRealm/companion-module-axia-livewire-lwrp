# companion-module-axia-livewire-lwrp

This module allows you to communicate with Axia Livewire Routing Protocol devices (such as xNodes and IP Drivers) from Bitfocus Companion.

While this module is a work-in-progress, it is already being used on-air for some radio stations. The aim is to get this submitted into the official collection of Companion modules.

## Building

Execute `yarn` command to install the dependencies.

The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `yarn dev` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.
